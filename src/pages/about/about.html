  <br>1. We believe in the plenary, verbal inspiration of the whole Bible and that it is the supreme and final authority in 
  faith and life. (II Timothy 3:16-17; II Peter 1:20-21).

  <br><br>2.We believe in one God, eternally existing in three persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. (Deut. 6:4; II Cor. 13:14).

  <br><br>3.We believe that Jesus Christ was conceived of the Holy Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary, and that He is true God and 
  true man. (Matt. 1:20-25; John 1:14; Romans 8:3).

  <br><br>4.We believe that man was created in the image of God; that all men have sinned in the transgression of Adam and subsequently 
  in their personal experience; that they are therefore totally depraved and "the wrath of God abideth on them;" and that the only way to escape 
  eternal condemnation is through the one gracious provision of the love of God. (Gen. 1:25-27; Rom. 3:22-26).

  <br><br>5.We believe that salvation is the gift of God offered to man by grace and received by personal faith in the Lord Jesus 
  Christ; that the Son of God gave "His life as a ransom for many" and bore "our sins in His own body on the tree;" and that all who truly believe 
  in Him are eternally saved on the ground of His shed blood. (Eph. 2:8-9; I Peter 2:24; John 10:28-29).

  <br><br>6.We believe in the personal bodily resurrection of our Lord and Savior, in His ascension into heaven, and in His present 
  mediatorial High Priestly office there at the right hand of the Father. (Acts 1:9; Luke 24:6-7; Heb. 9:24; 7:25).

  <br><br>7.We believe in "that blessed hope"â€”the personal, bodily, imminent, and pre-millennial return of the Lord Jesus Christ. 
  (Titus 2:13; Acts 1: 9-11).

  <br><br>8.We believe that all who receive by faith the Lord Jesus Christ are born again by the Holy Spirit and that the Holy Spirit 
  indwells every believer to enlighten, enable, and guide him in life and service. (John 3:6-7; I Cor. 2:12; John 14:16, 26; 16:24; Rom. 8:14).

  <br><br>9.We believe in the bodily resurrection of the just and the unjust, the everlasting blessedness of the saved, and the everlasting, 
  conscious punishment of the lost. (Mark 9:43-48; Rev. 20:15, 22:3-5, 11).
